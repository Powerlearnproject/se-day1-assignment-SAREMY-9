Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development.
It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications in a structured and efficient manner.

2.  Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1968 – NATO Conference on Software Engineering – Marked the formal recognition of software engineering as a discipline to address the "software crisis."
1970s – Development of the Waterfall Model – Provided a structured approach to software development.
2001 – Agile Manifesto – Shifted the industry toward flexible, iterative, and customer-focused development.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   Planning – Define goals, scope, and feasibility.
Requirements Analysis – Gather and document user needs.
Design – Create system architecture and UI/UX design.
Implementation – Write and integrate code.
Testing – Verify functionality, security, and performance.
Deployment – Release software for users.
Maintenance – Provide updates and bug fixes.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Feature 	       Waterfall	   Agile**
Approach	         Sequential	   Iterative
Flexibility	        Rigid	       Adaptable
Client Involvement	Limited	      Continuous
Testing	        After development	  Ongoing
Best for	Well-defined projects	Dynamic projects

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes, tests, and debugs code.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests and ensures software meets standards.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, team coordination, and deliverables.


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Enhance productivity by providing features like code completion and debugging (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) – Track code changes and enable collaboration (e.g., Git, GitHub).


7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Scope Creep – Define clear requirements and use Agile for adaptability.
Bug Management – Implement rigorous testing strategies.
Technical Debt – Follow best coding practices and refactor code regularly.


8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components to catch early bugs.
Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
System Testing – Verifies complete system functionality.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets user expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective prompts to interact with AI models efficiently.
It improves AI responses by ensuring clarity, relevance, and precision.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about cars."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the evolution of electric vehicles, highlighting key innovations from 2000 to 2024."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

Specificity – Focuses on electric vehicles instead of all cars.
Timeframe – Defines a period for relevant information.
Key Focus – Guides the AI to discuss innovations rather than general history.
